<ul>
    <li>{% trans "Temporarily store the password on the server. Your password is only stored in the server's encrypted memory. It would be cleared from the memory in an hour. After that, if you want to view the library, you'll have to enter password again." %}</li>
    <li>{% trans "Use in-browser decryption. The browser fetches encrypted data from the server and decrypt it within the browser. The advantage is that you don't need to expose your password to the server. But only latest browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, IE 10+) can support this feature." %}</li>
